## Introduction
Welcome to the Ngram Extractor Project! This project delves into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a specific focus on textual semantics. It leverages a portion of the WordNet Lexical database to achieve its goals.

In NLP, figuring out what a piece of text means is a bit like solving a puzzle. It's not as simple as just reading the words. 
Instead, the computer has to decode language syntax and extract semantics. This project predominantly focuses on the latter aspect, 
with the objective of decoding the significance of words, phrases, and compound terms using the power of N-grams.

N-grams have a vital role in uncovering the semantic meaning within text since they frequently contain information that extends beyond 
individual words. This project deals with the task of handling N-grams, looking for their existence in lexicons like WordNet, and outputting 
their parts of speech lexical definitions.

In this repository, I've included two versions of this project. The first version uses Python to efficiently find the definitions of n-grams 
within two text files, namely, NounsIndex.txt and NounsData.txt. The second version harnesses the NLTK library to explore lexical databases 
like WordNet for n-gram definitions. 

Feel free to dive into two versions of the code, experiment with the provided sample data, and if someone wants to add any new features, 
then feel free to contact me (patel.karan0496@gmail.com).
