In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify and try to correct social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story A Scandal in Bohemia, includes the character of Irene Adler who despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories picking The Adventure of the Speckled Band as his overall favourite.
